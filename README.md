### Hello World 🤖
I'm a linguist and tech-enjoyer from Germany researching AI and the gap in human-computer interaction. Currently learning to code buy creating either useful stuff (Corpus Analysis pipelines in Python and R), stuff that I enjoy personally (mostly games) or any kind of useful tools that could be of use.
